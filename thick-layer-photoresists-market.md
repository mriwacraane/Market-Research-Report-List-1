<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Layer Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The thick layer photoresists market is primarily categorized into two types: positive photoresists and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the patterned areas to be developed away, creating features on the substrate. In contrast, negative photoresists become insoluble when exposed, resulting in the unexposed areas being washed away during development. These types serve distinct applications in fields like microelectronics, MEMS, and photolithography, with specific advantages influencing their usage in various manufacturing processes.</p></p>
