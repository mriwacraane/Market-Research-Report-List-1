<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Desiccant Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heated Dryer</li><li>Heatless Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The desiccant dryer market features two primary types: heated dryers and heatless dryers. Heated dryers utilize an external heat source to regenerate the desiccant material, enhancing moisture removal efficiency, making them suitable for applications requiring lower dew points. Conversely, heatless dryers rely on a portion of the dried air to regenerate the desiccant, making them energy-efficient for less demanding applications. Both types serve critical roles in industries needing moisture control and air quality assurance, with specific advantages tailored to various operational needs.</p></p>
