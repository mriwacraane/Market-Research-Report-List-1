<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organi Ginger Oleoresin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Extraction</li><li>Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Organi Ginger Oleoresin market features two primary extraction methods: Solvent Extraction and Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE). Solvent Extraction utilizes organic solvents to dissolve and extract ginger compounds, resulting in a concentrated oleoresin. This method is cost-effective but may leave trace solvent residues.
